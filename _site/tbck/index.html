           <p><strong>TBCK: TBC1 Domain Containing Kinase</strong></p>
<blockquote>
<p>This gene encodes a protein that contains a protein kinase domain, a
Rhodanase-like domain and the <code>Tre-2/Bub2/Cdc16</code> (TBC) domain. The
encoded protein is thought to play a role in actin organization,
cell growth and cell proliferation by regulating the mammalian
target of the rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway. This protein may
also be involved in the transcriptional regulation of the components
of the mTOR complex. Alternative splicing results in multiple
transcript variants.</p>

<h1 id="what-is-the-tbc-domain">What is the TBC Domain?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Evolutionarily conserved protein domain</li>
</ul>
<h1 id="what-is-a-kinase">What is a Kinase?</h1>
<p>Catalyzes transfers of phosphates from high energy phosphate-donating
molecules to specific substrates. E.g., ATP -&gt; ADP, something that
happens 4 times during glycolysis. The production of energy during
glycolysis is exactly that process of ATP -&gt; ADP, as discussed in <a href="https://theproof.com/the-science-of-exercise-mitochondrial-health-and-longevity-with-biochemist-kieron-rooney/">THE
PROOF episode with Kieron
Rooney</a>.</p>
<h2 id="protein-kinase">Protein Kinase</h2>
<p>A Kinase which acts strictly on proteins as opposed to lipids, carbs,
or other molecules.</p>
<h1 id="ribosomes-mitochondria-and-energy-atp">Ribosomes, Mitochondria and Energy (ATP)</h1>
<blockquote>
<p>You can only turn fat into two carbon subunits that get put into the
mitochondria where you <strong>very efficiently</strong> make ATP, carbon
dioxide, and water vapor*.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><em><a href="https://youtu.be/7s7d7WNT1Ek?t=6202">Peter Attia from Rich Roll 695</a>
(citation needed)</em></p>
<p>Glycolysis isn’t less efficient than fat, both pyruvate and fatty
acids as the input into the mitochondria are very efficient, the
problem actually is that there isn’t enough oxygen to oxidize the
pyruvate, so the pyruvate gets turned into lactate, which yields
1/16th the ATP.</p>
<h1 id="what-is-the-mtor-pathway">What is the mTOR Pathway?</h1>
<ul>
<li>Complex 1 (mTORC1)
<ul>
<li>mTOR and Raptor</li>
<li>mLST8 (<span class="math inline">\(G \beta L\)</span>), stabilizes the kinase loop. It allows mTOR to
phosphorlate its target.</li>
<li>PRAS40 and DEPTOR inhibitors
<img src="/images/mtor1.png" alt="mTOR 1 complex" /></li>
</ul></li>
<li>Complex 2 (mTORC2)
<ul>
<li>DEPTOR inhibitor</li>
<li>Protor1/2 and mSin1 are regulators
<img src="/images/mtor2.png" alt="mTOR 2 complex" /></li>
</ul></li>
</ul>
<p>Drugs are used to inhibit the mTOR pathway, one of which is
rapamycin. Apparently rapamycin is only useful in complex 1.</p>
<h1 id="autophagy">Autophagy</h1>
<p>Autophagy is lysosomal recycling, essentially. It works via phagophore
which engulfs intracellular “cargo”, such as protein aggregates,
ribosomes, and organelles. This phagophore then fuses with the
lysosome, where its cargo is degraded via the lysosome’s acid
proteases. The byproducts of degradation are sent back out to the
cytoplasm where they can be reused for metabolism. This includes ATP
generation.</p>
<h1 id="lysosome">Lysosome</h1>
<p>The lysosome is a cell organelle that contains digestive parts. It
breaks down excess or worn out cell parts, they may also be used to
destroy invaders. Additionally, lysosomes may play a role in
self-destruction / programmed cell death / apoptosis.</p>
<h2 id="storage-diseases">Storage Diseases</h2>
<p>The TBCK paper from 2017 mentions similar “coarse facial features” to
those individuals affected by storage diseases. A storage disease is a
lysosomal disease, wherein the lysosome fails to do its autophagic
work, leaving the cell overloaded with substrates.</p>
<h1 id="the-logic-of-protein">The Logic of Protein</h1>
<p>These stream diagrams or whatever they’re called are interesting. The
red T arrow indicates an inhibitory relationship while the black arrow
indicates activation; but, as these things compose, their
relationships follow a logical dual. Here’s a few examples:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \dashv B \to C\)</span>: A inhibits B, which activates C, so A inhibits B</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(A \dashv B \dashv C\)</span>: A inhibits B, which inhibits C, so A
<em>activates</em> C.</li>
</ul>
<p>It’s the composition of two inhibitory relations that produce an
activating one. And the same for the composition of two activating
relations. Sounds like this is only the case for inhibitory relations.</p>
<h1 id="leucine">Leucine</h1>
<figure>
<img src="/images/leucine.png" alt="Leucine" />
<figcaption aria-hidden="true">Leucine</figcaption>
</figure>
<p>Following the logic here—that the composition of two inhibitors make
an activator—we can see that leucine is an <em>activator</em> for mTORC1:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Leucine} \dashv \text{Sestrin2} \dashv \text{GATOR2} \Rightarrow \text{Leucine} \rightarrow \text{GATOR2} \\
\text{GATOR2} \dashv \text{GATOR1} \dashv \text{RAG} \Rightarrow \text{GATOR2} \rightarrow \text{RAG}
\]</span></p>
<p>Therefore:</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
\text{Leucine} \rightarrow \text{Rag}\ (\text{mTORC1})
\]</span></p>
<blockquote>
<p>TBCK has been shown to regulate the mammalian target of rapamycin
(mTOR) signaling pathway, which is also stimulated by exogenous
leucine supplementation. <strong>TBCK was absent in cells from affected
individuals</strong>, and decreased phosphorylation of phospho-ribosomal
protein S6 was also observed, a finding suggestive of downregulation
of mTOR signaling.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is from the abstract of <em>Mutations in TBCK, Encoding
TBC1-Domain-Containing Kinase, Lead to a Recognizable Syndrome of
Intellectual Disability and Hypotonia</em> (emphasis is mine, though).</p>
<p>It feels like this implies that TBCK and leucine both have the same
job—activating mTORC1, so supplementing with leucine could “make up
for” the missing or pathologically low levels of TBCK. So the
hypothesis is correct here, but the causality is not:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>knockdown of TBCK decreases the transcription of mTOR complex
(mTORC) proteins and downregulates mTOR signaling.</p>
<p>This is why leucine helps, though, as it activates mTORC1.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><del>phospho-ribosomal protein S6, and its phosphorylation, and what
happens to S6 when it isn’t getting phosphorylated. Lysosome stress?
Storage disease?</del></p>
<p>No, rereading this, it sounds like decreased phosphorylation of S6 is
actually a sign that there’s been down regulation along mTOR.</p>
