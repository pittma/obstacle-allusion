           <p>After a week of listening pretty much exclusively to American
Football’s
<a href="https://open.spotify.com/album/7ki5b310cwDVVJBevBLwdw?si%253DjatKDZjtQgaT45nkJGHNHw"><em>LP3</em></a>
I recalled seeing in a review of <em>LP2</em> the mentioning of their musical
kinship, or maybe better put, descendance, from Steve Reich. I pulled
up Reich’s compilation, <em>The ECM Recordings</em> and was immediately
immersed into <em>Music For 18 Musicians</em> for my walk from the bus to the
office.</p>
<h2 id="monday-it-was-actually-tuesday">Monday (It was actually Tuesday)</h2>
<p>As I’d mentioned, I started the week with Reich’s <em>Music for 18
Musicians</em>, and by way of serendipity, I found my brain freed from the
lines of code waiting to be reviewed to be acutely attuned to the
music in my ears right as it reached the 33-minute mark. A
Cabernet-like full body swell fills in the minuscule gaps between the
percussive 16th notes looping over one another and <em>Music For 18
Musicians</em> becomes beautiful all at once.</p>
<h2 id="wednesday-where-wednesday-includes-tuesday-night">Wednesday (where “Wednesday” includes Tuesday night)</h2>
<p>Okay, so, a few years ago I learned about Meredith Monk’s <em>Songs of
Ascension</em> and about how it was performed. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3Dc3mSVR3xtfU">Monk and her Vocal
Ensemble occupied the spirals of Ann Hamilton’s Tower’s
staircase</a> and
literally ascended the stairs while performing the music of
<em>Songs</em>. To watch it is to plot its beauty on all its axes, however,
when only listening, one is left with merely a projection of its
intention, an abstraction of its possibility.</p>
<p>It’s funny, now that I’ve watched the video again, I feel silly
recapitulating my notes from my listening to this earlier this
week. But nevertheless, that <strong>is</strong> why I’m doing this. I found that,
without context, Monk’s music is hard to countenance. Her “vocal
explorations” really push the boundary on what I can take
seriously. Unlike <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v%3D75WFTHpOw8Y">Björk, for instance, who is course not beyond
reproach in terms of
seriousness-taking</a>
whose foray into vocal exploration with <em>Medulla</em> is quite palatable,
insofar as any other Björk record is at least. Monk’s and Björk’s
angles are, quite different, though. Monk is pushing the voice’s
purpose in a piece of music while Björk’s angle is more
paradoxical—hers is to hide it by making it serve <em>all</em> purposes.</p>
<p><em>Mapping</em>, <em>Songs</em>’ sixth track, presents with
Monk’s whimsical yelps and Xenakis-like percussion. It’s moments like
this that this line for me, that of seriousness-taking—which,
obviously, I’ve up to now been unable to give a proper title—is its
most tenuous. It’s a line drawn by our experience with art, by our
<em>context</em>, like, well, most anything else, really. When pondering the
effects of this absence of context, I find myself imagining its
opposite, i.e. to have <em>all</em> the context, about everything. Maybe this
is the distinction between a binary omniscience and something more
fluid, say, <em>enlightenment</em>. To know all is to never learn again,
the death of creativity. I’d posit that Epicureans would
say that this contextual evolution ought to be our <em>raison d’être</em> but
I think it’s more visceral than that; I’d say it how we know we’re
alive at all.</p>
