	 <section>
           <p>I started reading Bart Jacob’s <em>Categorical Logic and Type Theory</em>
book today after seeing it mentioned on the Category Theory Zulip
because I’ve been seriously itching to get back into some mathy /
formalish stuff—life in hardware/software land just hasn’t been
cutting it. I have heard a dozen times, I once even tried to slog
through the CwF paper, about the categorical semantics for type theory
being presheaf based as the presheaf apparently captures the notion of
type families. However, after reading through Chapter 0: Prospectus in
Jacobs’ book, it sounds like he’s going to use fibrations to talk
about indexing rather than presheafs, so I wanted to update my
understanding, precisely, on what a fibration actually was. After
having moderate success recently in asking it for help to remember how
to do <code>Either</code>-based error <em>returning</em> rather than exception
<em>throwing</em> in Haskell, I thought I’d chat with ChatGPT viz-a-viz
categorical fibrations. Here’s the first thing it told me, which makes
sense:</p>
<div class="multiline-quote">
<p>[A] functor <span class="math inline">\(F: C \to D\)</span> between categories is called a fibration if
for every morphism <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> in the codomain category D and for
every object <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> in the domain category <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, there exists:</p>
<ol type="1">
<li>An object <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f)\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, called the “fiber” or “preimage”
of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> under <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, and</li>
<li>A morphism <span class="math inline">\(p(f): \text{fib}(f) \to X\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, called the
“lifting” or “pullback” of <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> along <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>, such that <span class="math inline">\(F(p(f)) = f\)</span>.</li>
</ol>
</div>
<p>Ok GPT, I’m with you so far. So next I asked it if it could give me a
diagram. “Certainly!” it replied, followed with an example using the
category <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, a category with two objects <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>, and <em><em>only</em></em>
identity morphisms, and a functor <span class="math inline">\(F : C \to D\)</span> where <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> was the
category given by <span class="math inline">\(\langle\mathbb{N},\ \le\rangle\)</span>. It then gave an
example of a <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> that depended on a morphism in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> from <span class="math inline">\(0\)</span> to
<span class="math inline">\(1\)</span>. Which, in its own example did not exist.</p>
<p>I corrected it, telling that there was no morphism <span class="math inline">\(f : 0 \to 1\)</span> in
<span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>, so it gave me another example with <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> being the two object
category with <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and again only identity morphisms, and <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>
being <span class="math inline">\(\textbf{Set}\)</span>. And then proceeded to, three different times,
give me examples where the lifting morphism depended on a morphism <span class="math inline">\(A \to B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>Finally, it gave me an example that makes sense after I told it,
“That’s the same example! You’re still saying that id_A is A -&gt; B, but
this is only the case if A and B are isomorphic, leaving C to be a
category with one object rather than two.”</p>
<p>This time it told me that <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> was <span class="math inline">\(\text{Id}_X\)</span> then <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> was
<span class="math inline">\(\text{Id}_a\)</span>, but if <span class="math inline">\(f = \text{I}_Y\)</span>, then there was no morphism
that lifts <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>. Finally I asked it if the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p\)</span> could be</p>
<p><span class="math display">\[
p(f) = \left\{\begin{array}{lr}
  f = \text{Id}_X &amp; \text{Id}_A \\
  f = \text{Id}_Y &amp; \text{Id}_B
  \end{array}\right\}
\]</span></p>
<p>To which it said, ah, yes, that should work too:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Apologies for the confusion caused by my previous incorrect
statement. You are correct. In the given example, if f is the
identity morphism on Y (f = id_Y), then the fiber fib(f) is the
object B in C, and the lifting p(f) is the identity morphism id_B: B
-&gt; B.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Concluding with:</p>
<div class="multiline-quote">
<p>The fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is defined as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the identity morphism on <span class="math inline">\(X\ (f\ =\ id_X)\)</span>, then the fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f)\)</span>
is the object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the identity morphism on <span class="math inline">\(Y\ (f\ =\ id_Y)\)</span>, then the fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f)\)</span>
is the object <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>To define the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the identity morphism on <span class="math inline">\(X (f = id_X)\)</span>, then the lifting
<span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> is the identity morphism <span class="math inline">\(id_A: A \to A\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the identity morphism on <span class="math inline">\(Y (f = id_Y)\)</span>, then the lifting
<span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> is the identity morphism <span class="math inline">\(id_B: B \to B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>So if you’re following along this far you may have noticed that,
because of ChatGPT’s bad examples, I missed an important detail: <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span>
is supposed to be <span class="math inline">\(X \to Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>—it can’t be identities in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>! The
only way this works is if in <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span>’s domain category, there is at least
one morphism between <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span>. Here’s the last example that we
arrived at together:</p>
<div class="multiline-quote">
<p>Consider the category <span class="math inline">\(C = \{A, B\}\)</span> with two objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> and
two non-identity morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to B\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g: A \to B\)</span>. Let <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span> be
the category of sets.</p>
<p>Define a functor <span class="math inline">\(F: C \to D\)</span> as follows:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(A) = X\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> is a set,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(B) = Y\)</span>, where <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> is another set,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(f) = h: X \to Y\)</span>, a function from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>,</li>
<li><span class="math inline">\(F(g) = k: X \to Y\)</span>, another function from <span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> to <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In this case, the functor <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> maps objects <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to sets
<span class="math inline">\(X\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, respectively, and it maps the non-identity
morphisms <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(g\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> to the functions <span class="math inline">\(h\)</span> and <span class="math inline">\(k\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>To show that <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> is a fibration, let’s consider a morphism <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>.</p>
<p>The fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span> is defined as the object <span class="math inline">\(A\)</span>
in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</p>
<p>To define the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> for <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span>:</p>
<ul>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the function <span class="math inline">\(h: X \to Y\)</span>, the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> is the
morphism <span class="math inline">\(f: A \to B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
<li>If <span class="math inline">\(f\)</span> is the function <span class="math inline">\(k: X \to Y\)</span>, the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> is the
morphism <span class="math inline">\(g: A \to B\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>.</li>
</ul>
<p>In both cases, applying <span class="math inline">\(F\)</span> to the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> yields the original
morphism <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span>.</p>
<p>Therefore, the functor <span class="math inline">\(F: C \to D\)</span> is a fibration since, for every
morphism <span class="math inline">\(f: X \to Y\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(D\)</span>, the fiber <span class="math inline">\(\text{fib}(f) = A\)</span> in <span class="math inline">\(C\)</span>,
and the lifting <span class="math inline">\(p(f)\)</span> satisfies <span class="math inline">\(F(p(f)) = f\)</span>.</p>
</div>
<p>Which, as it states, satisfies <span class="math inline">\(F(p(f)) = f\)</span>. I love that everything
ChatGPT does is in the format that written standardized tests in
middle school were required to be… “In conclusion, …”</p>
<p>Anyway, we got there eventually, and now I feel like I actually know
what the hell a fibration is, and although it was an oblique route,
ChatGPT was yet again helpful.</p>
