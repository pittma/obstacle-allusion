<p>Radical and terrifying. The book opens with a Deleuze quote, and (of
course) I can’t help but think about through that lens. The House is a
palpable and properly insidious expression of the Oedipal triangle,
and it represents all that Deleuze and Guattari originally intended:
gender and sexual normativity, fascism, the strictures of societal
expectations and so on. In a pair of words, Freudian
psychoanalysis. Rumfitt gives her representation of this mental,
sexual, and societal cell the weight that it requires; to her it’s not
an observation from the relatively safe space of the 1970’s like D&amp;G’s
was. No, she knows how dangerous and real The House is. Tell Me I’m
Worthless is presentiment, not in language but in feeling. Portentous,
not through data or rationality, but through fear. It evinces the
existential terror we all felt on January 6th—we saw irrefutable truth
that fascism is here, and real—but Rumfitt does it through the lens of
someone whose whole life has been ruddered by that terror. She
viscerally illustrates that fascism is the cop inside your head and is
asking you to, in the words of Boston hardcore band Move, “kill the
cop inside your head, decarcerate your mind.”</p>
