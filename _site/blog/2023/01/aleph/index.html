           <blockquote>
<p>He’d come to understand the tongues of beasts at the cost of his
reason, while I was destroying human language to reveal the river of
nonsense coursing just beneath its “good, sound rules.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Ben Lerner, <em>The Topeka School</em></p>
<p>The most obvious way to examine the ontology of language is to think
of it as a tool for communication. But for it to be a tool that can
act as a medium, that tool must be concomitant with a set of agreed
upon rules. Creating something to countenance a set of predetermined
rules such as this is a form of <em>formalization</em>. The rules we use to
communicate, such as punctuation, sentence structure and so on, all
fall under the umbrella of syntax. Formalization like this is hard,
because signifying an intuition with a syntax is inherently a limiting
action. Ideas, intuitions, emotions, all of these exist in a
continuous space, unbroken by the limiting and discretizing force of
syntax. When we attempt to relate an idea via speech or writing, that
continuous space must be reduced into differentiable pieces. Deleuze
and Guattari wrote about this phenomenon and termed it
“territorializing”. To get a grip on their concept, think of a
pristine, undiscovered continent. Upon discovery, its (assumption:
capitalist) discoverers break the land up arbitrarily such that it may
be classified as states, countries, counties, or even parcels of land
to be sold. This is a material example of territorializing. But
Deleuze and Guattari didn’t stop there—they abstracted
territorializing and found limitless applications. Language itself is
a territorializer to our thoughts. Their most famous work, the
Capitalism and Schizophrenia series, discusses a “critical
schizophrenia”. A concept which can be weaponized to mean a lot of
things, like the justification for heterodoxical ideologies, but at
its core, it is a rejection of Freudian psychoanalysis. They saw
Freud’s raison to be the assimilation of the analysand while critical
schizophrenia refers to the untethered and unassimilated analysand—a
mind deterritorialized. Language, you see, according to Deleuze and
Guattari, is a gilded cage for your thoughts.</p>

<p><em>“There are things that are not sayable, that’s why we have art.” -
Leonora Carrington (La maja del tarot, 1965)</em></p>
<p>D&amp;G’s isn’t the only attempt to articulate such a phenomenon. It,
albeit in different terms, is also discussed in Bernard Steigler’s
book <em>For a New Critique of Political Economy</em>. Steigler makes the
point that the very act of writing a practice down, i.e.,
externalizing it from one’s mind, is a tool for oppression. His
argument is that <em>hypomnesis</em>, the exteriorization of memory, induces
the possibility of a management class. Hypomnesis’ antonym,
<em>anamnesis</em>, refers to internalized recollection or reference, without
the need for external aids. In a world primarily driven by anamnesis,
each generation learns its trade, its means for survival, from the one
that came before it. Knowledge is passed down directly, its purpose is
for the survival and the flourishing of generations to come. The point
that Stiegler is trying to make is that hypomnesis is how a managerial
class can invent itself, without the abstraction of exteriorization
there cannot be the abstraction of a managerial class; the two are
inextricably combined. Steigler’s is a Marxist argument: the
territorialization of generational knowledge is a cornerstone in
separating real value from use value, precisely through that
generative abstraction.</p>
<p class="pull">
What is a computer besides a territorializer of
electrons, anyway?
</p>
<p>I think Steigler is right w/r/t grammatization (his term for what
we’ve been calling territorializing, which actually comes from
Derrida’s reading of Plato) being a crucial tool for the oppression of
the working class, however, his theory’s veracity is in my opinion,
governed by the intent of the grammarizer. If you take Steigler’s
argument as I understand it to its terminus, you arrive at a ludditic
anarcho-primitivism, one that is in conflict with the perforce syntax
of mathematics, whose goal is to <em>universalize</em> access to precise
information. When we externalize a mathematical thought through
syntax, it isn’t for oppression, it’s to <em>verify</em>. Without a reduction
in fidelity, nothing could ever be checked, not just because
verification inherently entails exteriorization, but also because to
verify infinity, you would first need to calculate it. But, if we can
represent infinity in the finite through syntax, that implies we can
verify it as well. In fact, we can even ask a computer to verify that
syntax for us by presenting it with its own syntax, a set of rules,
which can be used to interpret and then validate the syntax we’ve
input. This is something a computer can do faster and with greater
precision than we can as humans for many reasons, not the least of
which is that a computer does not suffer the loss of fidelity or
struggle to discretize intuition because its entire existence is
resident in the world of syntax. What is a computer besides a
territorializer of electrons, anyway?</p>
<p>An example: The notion that a + b = b + a is something we intuitively
know, we’ve known it since not long after we learned addition. This
law is called commutativity, it generalizes the concept of being able
to flip operands and end up with the same result. Below is a proof of
the commutativity of addition on the natural numbers.</p>

<p>This proof, in a way, calculates infinity. The natural numbers are,
after all, an infinite set. The last stanza, those three lines that
begin with <code>+-comm</code>, comprise the commutativity proof, the other two
stanzas are subproofs needed to prove the final proof, often called
lemmas. This, to me, is irrefutable evidence of the limiting nature of
syntax. It’s through syntax, with which we signify infinity, that we
can begin to wrestle with it.</p>
<p>Another almost-articulation of this is Kant’s analytic and synthetic
divide. I’ll quote the
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/analytic-synthetic/">SEP</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“Analytic” sentences, such as “Pediatricians are doctors,” have
historically been characterized as ones that are true by virtue of the
meanings of their words alone and/or can be known to be so solely by
knowing those meanings. They are contrasted with more usual
“synthetic” sentences, such as “Pediatricians are rich,” (knowledge
of) whose truth depends also upon (knowledge of) the worldly fortunes
of pediatricians.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>What we have above is an analytic proof of the commutativity of
addition. Its synthetic proof, one more representative of our
intuition, would require infinite time and infinite resources. The
synthetic proof requires us to run every possible combination of pairs
of natural numbers, effectively squaring infinity. Now, obviously,
synthetic / analytic are not the same as the phenomenon of syntax’s
discretizing force. It would of course still be syntax that we’d use
to calculate infinity if we had infinite time to calculate it. Like
the sentences you’re reading here, we’d be using syntax to bridle
infinity. My goal instead is to articulate that all of these concepts
are related, somehow, but that we lack the medium through which to
elucidate exactly how. The notion of an unobtainable medium evinces
St. Anselm’s argument for the existence of God (again, from the
<a href="https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/ontological-arguments/">SEP</a>):</p>
<blockquote>
<p>St. Anselm reasoned that, if such a being fails to exist, then a
greater being—namely, a being than which no greater can be conceived,
and which exists—can be conceived. But this would be absurd: nothing
can be greater than a being than which no greater can be conceived. So
a being than which no greater can be conceived—i.e., God—exists.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>St. Anselm’s ontological argument makes the case that God is that
unattainable medium. It’s a medium, a being, a notion, a thought
that’s unscratchable by our feeble minds. It’s this that makes art
feel holy. It’s this that motivates why grappling with the foundations
of math ensnares me in such a way that I can lose time, whole hours,
when I’m given to its chase. It’s this that is the explanation for the
chill I’m feeling as I type this—I’m reaching out to something I
cannot see but am absolutely compelled by. Something I can only
picture through a glass, darkly. The pursuance of God.</p>
