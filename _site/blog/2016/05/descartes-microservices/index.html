           <p>And other annoying shit I’ve just made up.</p>
<p>This post is about dependency injection, a decoupling technique used
by programmers often with wanton abandon.</p>
<p>I’m not going to apologize for the above non-sequitur, but rather to
attempt to contextualize it. To begin, let’s talk about Descartes:</p>
<h3 id="rené-descartes">René Descartes</h3>
<p>Descartes is responsible for what is probably the penultimate
existential statement, eclipsed only by Shakespeare’s <em>“to be or not
to be”</em>. Descartes’s goes like this:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Cogito ergo sum</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Or</p>
<blockquote>
<p>I think, therefore I am.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Descartes’s whole spiel was I can’t doubt that I exist, because there
must be an “I” to doubt “I”. That is, doubting my existence is
dependent on me existing and then doubting that I exist. An
interesting strange loop indeed.</p>
<h3 id="computers">Computers</h3>
<p>I recently found myself in an analogous existential argument about
when a component in a program commenced to exist.</p>
<p>This component is <em>dependent</em> on another, and my coworker was of the
school of thought that this component’s constructor should be
<em>decoupled</em> from the injection of its dependency. Something like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb1"><pre class="sourceCode go"><code class="sourceCode go"><span id="cb1-1"><a href="#cb1-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">func</span> main<span class="op">()</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb1-2"><a href="#cb1-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>	t1 <span class="op">:=</span> thing1<span class="op">.</span>New<span class="op">()</span></span>
<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>	t2 <span class="op">:=</span> thing2<span class="op">.</span>New<span class="op">()</span></span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>	t1<span class="op">.</span>BindThing2<span class="op">(</span>t2<span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>However, <em>I</em> believed that there was no reason for <code>t1</code> to even be
constructed if it there was not yet a t2 to meet its dependency. Like
this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode" id="cb2"><pre class="sourceCode go"><code class="sourceCode go"><span id="cb2-1"><a href="#cb2-1" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="kw">func</span> main<span class="op">()</span> <span class="op">{</span></span>
<span id="cb2-2"><a href="#cb2-2" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>	t2 <span class="op">:=</span> thing2<span class="op">.</span>New<span class="op">()</span></span>
<span id="cb2-3"><a href="#cb2-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>	t1 <span class="op">:=</span> thing1<span class="op">.</span>New<span class="op">(</span>thing2<span class="op">)</span></span>
<span id="cb2-4"><a href="#cb2-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a><span class="op">}</span></span></code></pre></div>
<p>My coworker had a compelling argument. For us to reach optimal
clarity on his argument, we first must be <em>live</em>. That is,
<strong>consistent</strong> on our understanding of a few things, so I must
digress.</p>
<p>—- Begin Digression —-</p>
<h3 id="microservices">Microservices</h3>
<p>A overloaded term which, to me, means Domain Driven Design, where each
“domain” is composed of subdomains (read: microservices) of
functionality.</p>
<p>For example, you have a group of services which mutate <code>Foo</code>s, and a
group of services which mutate <code>Bar</code>s. Each of these “domains” have
independent services which have discrete responsibilities such as
<code>paint-bar</code> or <code>flip-foo</code>. A service in the <code>Foo</code> domain has no
knowledge of a <code>Bar</code> whatsoever. Ideally not even through a
dependency like an ORM with both <code>Foo</code> and <code>Bar</code> declarations within
it. This complete, physical delineation protects each domain from the
other’s faults.</p>
<h3 id="the-go-programming-language">The Go Programming Language</h3>
<p>An interesting thing about the design of the Go programming language
is that the language itself gently leads you down the path towards
something microservice-like even though your software may exist
completely in a single runtime. This is done through goroutines,
channels, and long-running loops. With Go, you find yourself writing a
distributed system, passing messages back and forth between disparate,
long-running, reactive loops all within a single runtime. It’s
important to consider this mindset when considering my coworker’s
argument.</p>
<p>—- End Digression —-</p>
<p>So, given this context, when does a service commence existence? Is it
at instantiation? Or, when it becomes <em>useful</em>, with all its
subsystems in line and ready to take on the world?</p>
<p>What do you think?</p>
