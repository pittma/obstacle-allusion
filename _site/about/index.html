           <p>I've tried probably a dozen platforms, approaches, and styles for
places for me to exorcize my thoughts, to emanate my <i>vibe</i>, but
nothing has ever felt quite right. The purpose of <i>Obstacle
Allusion</i> is for me to do just that, but to do it untethered from a
need to defend or justify any of the connections I find in my
head. Think of it as a map—a place to trace any and all of
my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_flight">lines of
flight</a>.</p>

<p>If I've learned anything through everything I've tried, it's that
I'm not really a writer, I'm actually just a <i>blogger</i>. I've
tried to categorize everything I've written by finding the right
outlet for each little fracture of myself I'm shining light on with
any given piece of writing, trying desperately to keep one identity
from reflecting another. But it turns out what I really need to do to
be a whole person is to put all the fractures together into a singular
mirror, so that's what you'll find here. I collected all the writing
I've done on the Internet over the last 10 years or so (going back to
2014) and dropped them here, incongruences, fleeting interests, and
all.</p>

<p>The name “obstacle allusion”, obviously a play on “optical
illusion”, comes from hearing a young boy ask his mom, after
mishearing the latter, what an obstacle allusion was. To me, obstacle
allusion captures
the <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/">vibe</a>—an
otherwise inarticulable ontology—for the theory I'm drawn to. Deleuze
and Guattari's entire metaphysics alludes to the obstacle of the
normative engine that is traditional psychoanalysis; it's an
elucidation whose goal is to transcend that normativity. My hope can
only be that Obstacle Allusion is a space for me to do exactly
that.</p>
