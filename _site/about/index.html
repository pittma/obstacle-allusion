           <h1 class="post-title">About This Site</h1>

<p>I've tried probably a dozen platforms, approaches, and styles for
places for me to exorcize my thoughts, to emanate my <i>vibe</i>, but
nothing has ever felt quite right. The purpose of <i>Obstacle
Allusion</i> is for me to do just that, but to do it untethered from a
need to defend or justify any of the connections I find in my
head. Think of it as a map—a place to trace any and all of
my <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Line_of_flight">lines of
flight</a>.</p>

<p>The name “obstacle allusion”, obviously a play on “optical
illusion”, comes from hearing a young boy ask his mom, after
mishearing the latter, what an obstacle allusion was. To me, obstacle
allusion captures
the <a href="https://www.glass-bead.org/article/a-theory-of-vibe/">vibe</a>—an
otherwise inarticulable ontology—for the theory I'm drawn
to. Deleuze and Guattari's entire metaphysics alludes to the obstacle
of the normative engine that is traditional psychoanalysis; it's an
elucidation whose goal is to transcend that normativity. My hope can
only be that Obstacle Allusion is a space for me to do exactly
that.</p>
